  Abstract                 = {An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes dynamically forming a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. Due to the limited transmission range of wireless network interfaces, multiple network "hops" may be needed for one node to exchange data with another across the network. In recent years, a variety of new routing protocols targeted specifically at this environment have been developed, but little performance information on each protocol and no realistic performance comparison between them is available. This paper presents the results of a detailed packet-level simulation comparing four multi-hop wireless ad hoc network routing protocols that cover a range of design choices: DSDV, TORA, DSR, and AODV. We have extended the ns-2 network simulator to accurately model the MAC and physical-layer behavior of the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard, including a realistic wireless transmission channel model, and present the results of simulations of networks of 50 mobile nodes.},

In this article we provide a thorough overview of the novel functionalities defined in Wi-Fi Direct, and present an experimental evaluation that portrays the performance to be expected in real scenarios. In particular, our results quantify the delays to be expected in practice when Wi-Fi Direct devices discover each other and establish a connection, and the performance of its novel power saving protocols. To the best of the authors¿ knowledge this is the first article in the state of the art that provides a wide overview and experimental evaluation of Wi-Fi Direct.},

  Abstract                 = {Connectivity is probably the most basic building block of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Up to know, the two main approaches to provide data access to the things have been based either on multi-hop mesh networks using short- range communication technologies in the unlicensed spectrum, or on long-range, legacy cellular technologies, mainly 2G/GSM, operating in the corresponding licensed frequency bands. Re- cently, these reference models have been challenged by a new type of wireless connectivity, characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands, used to realize access networks with star topology which are referred to a Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). In this paper, we introduce this new approach to provide connectivity in the IoT scenario, discussing its advantages over the established paradigms in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and architectural design, in particular for the typical Smart Cities applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation. OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is intended to guide developers of wireless systems who are puzzled by the vast number of radio configuration parameters and options. We provide experimental data comparing power consumption of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee and ANT protocols for a cyclic sleep scenario, in which a short-range and low-power wireless sensor node periodically sends a data packet to a remote `hub' with intervening sleep intervals. Devices such as wearable health monitors often use this scenario when interfacing with a mobile phone-based hub. For all measured sleep intervals BLE achieved lower power consumption (10.1 uA, 3.3 V supply at 120 s interval), compared with ZigBee (15.7 uA), and ANT (28.2 uA). Most of the power consumption differences can be attributed to the time taken for a node to connect to the hub after waking up and the use of sleep between individual RF packets. For the three protocols we determined a sleep interval at which the tradeoff between power consumption and data rate is optimized.},

  Abstract                 = {IEEE 802.11s is one of the emerging standards designed to build wireless mesh networks whichmay serve to extend the coverage of access networks. The default IEEE 802.11s path selection protocol Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) is based on the radio-aware airtime link metric (ALM) that outper forms the hop-count metric in single channel multi-hop wireless networks. However, this metric may lead to capacity degradation when multiple channels and/or multi-radio are used. To fully exploit the capacity gain of multiple channels use, new routing metrics have been proposed such as weighted cumulative expected transmission time, metric of interference and channel switching, interference aware routing metric, exclusive expected transmission time, and normalized bottleneck link capacity. These metrics distribute the data traffic load among channels and/or radios to reach the final destination. In this paper, we provide a qualitative comparison study that considers the characteristics of these metrics. Indeed, we substitute ALM by these different metrics, and we evaluate the performance of HWMP through simulation. Obtained results allow us to identify the appropriate use case of each metric.},

However, multi-Gbps throughput and small interference footprint come at the price of adverse signal propagation characteristics and require a fundamental rethinking of Wi-Fi communication principles. This paper describes the design assumptions taken into consideration for the IEEE 802.11ad standard and the novel techniques defined to overcome the challenges of mm-Wave communication. In particular we study the transition from omni-directional to highly directional communication and its impact on the design of IEEE 802.11ad.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to their easy-to-deploy and self-healing features, WMNs (Wireless Mesh Networks) are emerging as a new promising technology with a rich set of applications. While the IEEE standardization of this new technology is still in progress, its main traits are already set, e.g., architecture and MAC routing. WMNs are attracting considerable research in academia and industry as well, but the lack of open-source testbeds is restricting such a research to simulation tools. The main problem with simulation tools is that they do not reflect the complexity of RF propagation, especially in indoor environments, of which IEEE 802.11s WMNs are an example. This paper presents an open-source implementation of an indoor IEEE 802.11s WMN testbed. The implementation is transparent, easy-to-deploy, and both the source code and deployment instructions are available online. The implementation can serve as a blueprint for the WMN research community to deploy their own testbeds, negating the shortcomings of using simulation tools. By delving into the testbed implementation subtleties, this paper is shedding further light on the details of the ongoing IEEE 802.11s standard. Major encountered implementation problems (e.g., clients association, Internetworking, and supporting multiple gateways) are identified and addressed. To ascertain the functionality of the testbed, both UDP and TCP traffic are supported and operational. The testbed uses the default IEEE 802.11s HWMP (Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol) routing protocol along with the default IEEE 802.11s Airtime routing metric.},
